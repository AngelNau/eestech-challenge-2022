# Challenge description

TODO: Add description of the water leakage challenge.

Having an unidentified leak is nerve-wracking. There is no way to know the extent of the issue or damage being done until you find and repair the source. If you suspect there is a leak inside of a wall, don't panicâ€”you may be able to address it without major maintenance or shelling out for a repair.

Water leaks are often because of pinholes in your plumbing system or small failures in caulking or other exterior materials. Water takes the easiest path down to the ground, so it will often travel along the framing in the walls. If you are not sure, use a moisture meter to find out if the moisture levels in your home are within normal parameters and an infrared camera to look for leaks behind walls and ceilings.

Implement your solution in [predict.py](leak_detection.py) under the method predict. The method takes in a list of features and should return a boolean.
It should return true if leak is detected, otherwise it should return false. You can create new files and import them into predict.py.
evaluate.py is an example of how predict method will be called for evaluation. You can use it to test your solution.
