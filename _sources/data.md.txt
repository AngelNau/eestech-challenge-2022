# Datasets

The challenge will be devided in two parts. Therefore two dieerent databsets will 
be avaible, deliverd, collected and obtained by [Medius d.o.o.](https://medius.si). 

Both databsetsA cosist of different leakage scenarios, they both include data such as:

* leakage (4 different levels) 
* opraters changes in pipeline system (4 different levels)
* missing data 

All signals are recoreded from micro turbines, and present the:

* pressure[bar],
* turine load[mA,
* currnet[mA],
* turbine voltage[V],
* turbine speed[rpm]

The team members will be able to download data from provided url on the challege start time.
