## Leakage detection

# Instruction
Implement your solution in [predict.py](leak_detection.py) under the method predict. The method takes in a list of features and should return a boolean.
It should return true if leak is detected, otherwise it should return false. You can create new files and import them into predict.py.
evaluate.py is an example of how predict method will be called for evaluation. You can use it to test your solution.
